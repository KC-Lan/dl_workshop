# Notebooks
This directory contains the notebooks for the two demonstrations in the workshop.

The first demo, [network_train_demo.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rl7DwrjGbqFF9vFd3TeusLLnnNH87eVD?usp=sharing), explains how to implement and train a basic neural network in pytorch.
The second demo, [DeepSEA_Demo.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q1nK4xSZu0ma871D1XqeWF92WfB0UjH0?usp=sharing), shows how pretrained models from places like [Kipoi](http://kipoi.org/) can be applied to biological problems.

## Usage
Ideally the notebooks will be executed on Google CoLab via the links above.
If you want to run the notebooks locally, you can download them from this repo, though you may not want to run the conda installation portions of `DeepSEA_Demo.ipynb` if you already have conda.
